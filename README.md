# Welcome to my portfolio website!

This website was built using React, Next.js and Tailwind CSS. It is designed to showcase my professional experience and skills, as
well as provide information about me and my interests.

In addition to functioning as a personal blog, this website shows what I'm listening to on Spotify. This
is a cool way to give visitors an insight into my personal music preferences and adds a dynamic element to the website. I hope to
add additional features and content to my portfolio website in the future.

Feel free to explore the different sections, and contact me if you have any questions or would like to work
together.
